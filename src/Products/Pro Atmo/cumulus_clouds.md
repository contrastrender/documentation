# Cumulus Clouds

## About

This asset library contains a bunch of different cumulus clouds which are stored as vdbs and use a custom clouds shader. Each Asset can be easily be imported into the scene by using Blenders asset-browser.

You can add this library to the asset-browser by navigating to: file -> preferences -> asset-library -> Add -> select cumulus_clouds.blend -> Add to Library

Now you can simply drag and drop the assets into your scene.

## Render Settings

I would recommend using around 8 light bounces for volumes, otherwise the clouds are not receving enough light resulting in a dark tint.
